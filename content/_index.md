I’m currently learning in [uOttawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/en)’s 2029 CO-OP Computer Engineering class. I am also a member of the [uOttawa Aeronautics Team](https://aeronautics.uottawa.xyz), a JMTS team that builds RC aircraft for SAE competitions.

You can find me on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/bygones), [Github](https://github.com/YannHS), and  Email 📪  (**yanඞdierolf.ca**).
